# Control Tutorials
This repository is designated for learning and understanding modeling and analysis of control systems using tutorials by UMich, CMU, and Detroit Mercy

## Objectives
- learn to use MATLAB and Simulink more fluidly
- learn to convert mathematical and physics theory into block-based modeling and programming
- use and experiment with known control systems (i.e. cruise control, suspsension, aircraft pitch, etc.)
